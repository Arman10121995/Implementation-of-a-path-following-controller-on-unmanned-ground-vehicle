# Implementation-of-a-path-following-controller-on-unmanned-ground-vehicle
Designing a safe path for an unmanned vehicle is a crucial problem. The path should be not only obstacle free but also take into account the vehicle dynamics so that the path is feasible. Once the path is generated a path following controller should be able to execute this path driving the vehicle from certain start point to final destination point. Working in a group of 2 students, the aim of this project (given the obstacle free path) is to : 1. Define the working environment (start point, end points and obstacles) 2. Implement a path following model predictive controller on a ground vehicle Hamster (see figure). 3. Prepare a presentation for the achieved tasks Subject areas: Robotics, Optimal Control, Path Planning, Programming
