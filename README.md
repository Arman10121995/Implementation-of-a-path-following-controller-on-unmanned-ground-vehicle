# Implementation-of-a-path-following-controller-on-unmanned-ground-vehicle
Designing a safe path for an unmanned vehicle is a crucial problem. The path should be not only obstacle free but also take into account the vehicle dynamics so that the path is feasible. Once the path is generated a path following controller should be able to execute this path driving the vehicle from certain start point to final destination point. 
• Path Planning, obstacle avoidance, and path optimization using ACADO solver in MatLab
• Implementation of a path following Nonlinear model predictive controller on a ground vehicle Hamster 
• Using ROS(robotic Operating System) for Hardware implementation on real UGV
• Using Optitrack to define the environment and localize the Hamster
